## Use cases

1. Ichihime wants to play a round of Japanese mahjong. She runs the
Japanese mahjong program where the program automatically shuffles tiles and
distributes an initial hand of 13/14 tiles to players. Since Ichihime is the dealer,
she gets 14 tiles and begins the first. When she is playing, the program shows
scores on how well she has been performing. After multiple turns where
Ichihime and other players perform drawing, discarding, Chii, Pon, and Kan,
another player wins by Ron as Ichihime discards a card the player wants. The
program displays how many scores the player has won, the list of combinations
(yaku) that contribute to the player’s scores, and how many Ichihime has to pay
to that player.
2. Julia wants to play a round of Japanese mahjong. She runs the Japanese
mahjong program where the program automatically shuffles tiles and distributes
an initial hand of 13/14 tiles to players. Julia is not the dealer, so she gets 13 tiles
and begins after the dealer. She draws a card, and she is very lucky that she
directly wins! The program displays the scores Julia has won with the special
combination. (Julia’s Story)
3.Bill likes to teach others how to play games in general. However, his friend
sometimes argues that his teaching is not correct. He needs a simulation tool
with feedback to prove to his friend that his strategies are correct. (Bill’s Story)
4.Enming wants to test his new neural network framework on reinforcement
learning which he just published on NeurIPS. Thus, he needs an interface to test
his AI bot. The interface needs to accurately record the result of a play in
formatted json file, and ideally can also provide some feedback on bot’s
performance. (Yizhou’s Story)
5.Yi wishes to learn Japanese Mahjong. By using our project to play multiple
rounds and receiving feedback from the AI, he quickly grasped the basic rules and
strategies of the game. (Tianchu’s Story)
